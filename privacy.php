        pseudonym) and a password are required. An email address can be voluntarily
		entered and it will only be used to recover a lost password.<br>
        <strong>Data storage duration:</strong> Until user change data or
        deletes their account. <br>
        <strong>Visibility:</strong> Only to site administrators. Not public.</li>

        for relevant data, and for each record uploaded, at maximum the callsign,

        <strong>Visibility:</strong> Only to the user and site administrator.</li>
    <li><strong>Any other data:</strong> Any other data not mentioned is always
        handled with the utmost care and by the priciple of minimizing
        data.</li>

</ul>
